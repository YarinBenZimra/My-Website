  "Designed and developed a cross-platform educational tool for iOS and Android to help language learners select contextually appropriate near synonyms. Collected real-world sentence examples and analyzed them using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM) to compute perplexity and probability, ensuring accurate synonym selection. Technologies used: React Native, Node.js, OpenAI API.",
  "Developed an application that uses Facebook's API and realizes design patterns using Windows Forms as windows-based user interface.",
  "Created an environment that simulates Facebook in a console-based user interface in C++.",
  "Developed a full-stack project featuring a containerized HTTP server for a TODO app in JavaScript with integrated logging capabilities using Docker, complemented by a Flutter-based task management app for iOS and Android that serves as the client for the Node.js server.",
